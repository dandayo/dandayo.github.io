                            <h2>Population</h2>   
                            <p>It was long believed that the Korean people originally may have had links with the people of Central Asia, 
                                the Lake Baikal region of Siberia, Mongolia, and the coastal areas of the Yellow Sea. Tools of Paleolithic type and other artifacts found in Sokch’ang, 
                                near Kongju, are quite similar to those of the Lake Baikal and Mongolian areas. In 2017, genetic analysis of bones found in Primorye kray in Far Eastern Russia 
                                suggested that Koreans were related to a population that had inhabited that area for at least 7,700 years. The genes of these Neolithic humans were expressed 
                                alongside those of indigenous agriculturalists from Southeast Asia to produce the genetic structure of modern Koreans.</p>
