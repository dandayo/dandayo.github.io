                        <p>Moscow has got its name from the river that runs through it, the Moskva. “Moscow” meant “wet.”
                            Moscow is the largest European city having an area of 2511 square km and with a population 
                            of 12 million. This is usually the population of various countries such as Norway and Switzerland. 
                            Technically, Moscow is so huge that it deserves all rights to be a country.</p>

                    <p>Vladimir Putin was born in 1952 in Leningrad (now known as St Petersburg). 
                        He grew up in a communal apartment, studied at local schools, before graduating with 
                        a law degree from Leningrad State University (now St Petersburg State University). 
                        He is on the list of honorary citizens of St Petersburg, an award handed out to no 
                        more than two people annually.</p>

                        <h3>St Petersburg used to be called Leningrad</h3>
                        <p>St Petersburg was founded by Tsar Peter I. It is widely believed that the name was 
                            chosen to honour himself. But in actual fact, the city was named after the tsar’s 
                            patron saint, the apostle Saint Peter. After World War I, there was widespread anti-German 
                            sentiment, and so the city’s name was changed to Petrograd, which sounded less Germanic than 
                            Sankt Peterburg. Following the socialist revolution, the city was renamed again to Leningrad, 
                            to honour the communist revolutionary, Vladimir Lenin. The city’s name finally reverted back to 
                            St Petersburg after the fall of the Soviet Union. Colloquially, the city is often referred to as just Piter.</p>

                            <p>The fact that the Koryaksky, Avachinsky and Kozelsky volcanoes, which in good weather conditions are 
                                visible from anywhere in Kamchatka’s capital, are talked about in friendly and familiar terms 
                                (like domashny, or 'domestic' volcano) by local residents can provoke some shock among travelers: 
                                Two of these giants are in fact active and periodically they “sneeze” (at such moments the town residents 
                                feel some mild underground seismic shocks) or their summits slightly “smoke.” Living amidst volcanoes has made 
                                local residents not only used to such phenomena (many houses in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky are reinforced 
                                by special quake proof technology), but also particularly 
                                sensitive observers of even the smallest changes in the behavior of their menacing neighbors.  </p>

                                    Lake Baikal is the world’s largest freshwater lake in terms of volume. It is about 640 km (397 miles) long,

                                    It contains 20% of the world’s total unfrozen freshwater reserve.</p>
